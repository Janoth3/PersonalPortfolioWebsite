        <p class="aboutMyself">
            I am an aspiring programmer currently studying Computer Science with Industrial Experience at Queen Mary University
            of London. I have chosen to pursue programming as a career, not only because I find it fun, but because I feel that
            programming is an art form that gives you the freedom to create anything you want, with the only limitation being your
            imagination.

            My first interaction with computer science was through the family computer, which I often used to play flash games.
            However, it was after I saw a computer repair that I was interested in learning more about computers. Whenever I was
            given the chance in school, I would learn more and more about IT and Technology, and did Computer Science for my GCSE
            and A-Levels. After A-Levels, I wanted to expand my knowledge even further and pursue a career in the sector of IT, which
            is what led to me choosing to study Computer Science at university.

        <p class="aboutMyself">
            Outside of education, my hobbies include gaming, watching anime, and self-improvement. I use a PS4 as my main gaming console
            and some of my favourite games include Assassin's Creed, Brawlhalla and Need For Speed, with my favourite gaming genre being
            open world free roam exploration games. My favourite animes so far include Noragami, Angel Beats, and Future Diary, with my
            favourite anime character being All Might from My Hero Academia. As for self-improvement, this ranges from exercise and strength
            training to research and planning my future to make sure I make the most out of the time I have. One self-improvement techinque
            I would recommend everyone to try is cold showers, as they have a multitude of benefits; some of which include: dealing with stress/
            learning how to be more accepting, better circulation of blood throughout the body, more flexibility when it comes to your environment,
            and wasting less water.
