                <h3>Lego Robotics (2016)</h3>
                <p class="aboutMyself">
                    We had to program robots using an application similar to Scratch coding in order to perform various specific
                    tasks such as picking up a block and transporting it to a specific location or to navigate an obstacle course.
                    There was a certain level of pressure in doing this, as we would be competing against students from other schools
                    to see whose robot was more efficient in its tasks. This opened the opportunity to think outside the box and code
                    the robots in creative ways, such as pushing the block to transport it instead of picking it up in order to save time
                    or taking shortcuts/more efficient routes resembling racing lines in the obstacle course.

                <h3>Downhurst Residential Home (2019)</h3>
                <p class="aboutMyself">
                    As part of NCS, in our third week we had to do some sort of volunteering work to help out our neighbourhood
                    in some way. Me and my team decided to help out a local residential home (Downhurst Residential Home) by raising
                    awareness for loneliness in elders via handing out informative leaflets to the public and talking to members of
                    the public on said issue. We also held a fundraiser and managed to raise some money for the care home which went
                    towards building a fountain for them in their garden.
