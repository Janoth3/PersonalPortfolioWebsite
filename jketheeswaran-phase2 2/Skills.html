            From the chart, we can see that my strengths include Java, communication skills, teamwork skills and
            organisation skills. Some of my weaknesses include leadership skills (due to a lack of confidence) and
            Javascript, as it is something new that I've learned and something that I've not had as much time to refine
            as much as something like Java, which I've been learning for 5 years now.
